# TeamBuilder

Welcome to Team Builder!

Welcome to our new repo! **TeamBuilder is currently an open source project. See the bottom of this page for the license details. Thanks!**

Need a Team? The idea is to build a Team for anything and everything! Video games, sports, etc. The most quick and simple roster mechanics, for the maximum playtime! Now that's efficiency! Also designed in a way where all other team building apps can all work together using a common roster language! This includes anywhere at all where a team roster is hosted, any app, any website, and any upload. The final tool would solve for the mechanics of the team itself, using a common roster parser. Basically, any and all roster(s) have the same common pieces, and that never changes no matter what! Simply upload or link any roster via TeamBuilders Web API call. You only call a URL, upload roster, or text, or automatically POST to TeamBuilder API, and that's it! You're now hosting a roster in a common central roster share. You are either the Host or the Player. Host(s) see player(s), and player(s) see Host(s).

The idea of joining or hosting a team, became of ever-increasing value, to my pick-up sports crews, as well as to my gamer groups and I, shortly after college, (a tech school). Playing sports was simply not satisfying alone, along with many different events such as, gaming, pick-up-games, and other events where a team could or would enable playtime. I soon noticed, that my desire for a team was increasing more and more, especially through the advancement of technology growth, which presented more opportunities and ideas than ever before! As a gamer, my friends and I studied how to prepare, to have the edge of efficiency, during new game releases also! This included anything where a team could be of bonus, advantage, or the key to playing at all, such as player vs player ranking also! As I played sports, I began attending many pick-up-games, in order to play more frequently, as well as to increase my play-time efficiency. As games commonly ended early due to roster and attendance or recruiting lack thereof. I began to study the overall-challenge, and noticed that much more time was spent hoping and trying to convince those that had to go, to stay, and noticed much more time was spent managing or not playing. I sadly endured, with my other teammates, how much more time was spent enduring the roster, or trying to get everyone to stay, so that the team would not crumble early. I began to consider the challenge of the mechanics of the team itself, and thought what could remain longer? As games just were not promising on a routine attendance, and the amount of overhead time of managing or finding a replacement. I also desired a way to have a full team for an extended or routine amount of time. I considered clever ideas to refill empty positions, without missing the new game release, only to be left in the dust. One example, was pushing for a world-first achievements, during new game releases. Also, to play at all, or more, during sporting events. Often blocked during times when a full team was needed for a satisfying accurate game. 

How Could I Make it Happen?

Making a team event happen, maintaining, or joining a team, ended up being the exact use-case for TeamBuilder, and what it will eventually deliver! Quick and reliable plug-and-play for any empty spots, or hosting, is key to have a full game experience. Moreso, the key to enable 'play-as-desired' and 'continue-playing-as-desired'. These are the mechanics of enabling team-play as defined. This is the purpose of TeamBuilder, why it does not change, no matter the team category, and why it remains as simple as possible! 

Efficiency Defined?

Efficiency defined means, maximum playtime for the least amount of downtime. Every team, no matter what category, shares the same common mechanics. This is why TeamBuilder can simply solve for the 'team' itself! Because the common parts of team, roster, hosting, and playing, are the same common pieces, for every team. These same common pieces will never change, no matter what. TeamBuilder delivers, once efficient, the Capital T in as many Team(s) as possible, for the most amount of choices, through shared roster. The more rosters that are shared, means solving for if ever needing replacements, subs, or finding a team, as fast as possible! Ideally, efficiency achieved proves, maximum playtime and/or opportunity. As easy as it will be to play, will be the same simplicity for what you can simply Host, when a team is not available. TeamBuilder atleast solves for your highest chance at playing longer, and for saving you the most time possible! TeamBuilder delivers the highest chance to get back to the game, your goal the entire time, through increasing availability and chance at forming and finding a team. This is why a sharing a roster centrally, is the integral step, no matter which app, to solve for the team building mechanics, it's rather a physically nescessary requirement.

What Does This Product Deliver?

This team building product will deliver, upon solving for the team itself, hosting or playing, defined. Maximum efficiency, means that your team has the highest chance to refill, has the smoothest turnover replacement, substitute, and that players will have the highest chance to find a team. Upon solving for this tool, both host and player, are garanteed the highest chance that you will have the maximum playtime, with the least amount of downtime! This means that the least amount of time managing, or fumbling distraction, and the MAXIMUM amount of time playing, or attending any hosted event! 

Efficiency continued...

TeamBuilder is not doing anything out of the ordinary, it's just automating everything simply possible for maximum play time, at the least amount of downtime. For the maximum play, or more frequently desired playtime, even availability as a list of choices. Together, we will put the Capital 'T' in Team, once TeamBuilder's design is solved for! Upon this team building tool design delivering the most efficiency, then TeamBuilder too will now have the Capital T in it's Team building ability. This is when TeamBuilder is integral to your use, because we want the highest chance at joining or finding a team, with a little downtime as possible, and as the highest chance at possibility! Efficiency delivered further proven, at the most simple use. 
TeamBuilder applies to more than just sports and games, it solves for the mechanics of building any and all team(s) by definition! TeamBuilder will work for anything and everything possible, where a team is needed! Examples of use include, sports, church groups, anything that apps like meetup.com (or similar) host, events, school events, games, after-school pick-up-games, sports, sports practice training, fishing, announced games, world-first groups, professional, casual, parse-perfection ranking, any roster, any event. Just imagine the potential! Unlock your imagination, host it, or search for any team, as design is the key to success at almost everything! Solving for the mechanics of what it takes to build, host, and join a team, keep a team going, solves directly for the Capital 'T' in Team, aka solves for the mechanics of the team itself, and enables your inspiration!

About me:

I have been an inventor-minded engineer since childhood. I really enjoy software engineering, and using (or imagining), the latest technology. My thrill is to invent and solve for common repeated challenges, such as time-sinks, and design ways to enable doing what people desire to do with their time. Satisfatication to me, is finding solutions to challenges by saving repeated lost hours through automation. I found that enabling someones time has allowed them to focus back on our own personal needs, and no longer repeatly satisfying a flawed design. Design is the key to happiness for almost everything! I have discovered that saving someone time through improving design of interaction, is more valuable than money! Automated design solves for the amount of time, stress, and repeated action, forever, for all individuals, whom may use a system! I found that pay was being lost, due to having to waste time repeating the same actions over and over, so I sorted by most repeated actions, and solved for the largest time-sinks first. There's nothing more satisfying than allowing others or I, to be able to focus on our own abilities again, and not a calculator of time-lost. This is that proved that automating flawed designs, is more valuable, as man-hours lost, are much more expensive. 
This project is also how I practiced Web API and the latest REST technologies during a lengthy interview process, what more fun could I ask for? This was the perfect study tool, meanwhile leading into the future challenge of building a team everything possible!


All ideas are encouraged! What solves for inspiration?


Where did **TeamBuilder** come from?
My open source hobby project! Building a team is still one of the most repeatedly-burdening challenges around the world today! This is why I encourage everyone whom may feel inspired, to participate and contribute as you desire to! You are all a part of the global Team, that TeamBuilder is solving for, just as there is no I in team, there is no TeamBuilder with I alone! You may freely contribute at no cost at all! Inspiration is the only proven real contribution. 


Future Goals of TeamBuilder?

One long term proof, is for the world's first pick up group to beat a real professional team, (as the fun proof), of TeamBuilder's ultimate success! Imagine being actually prepared to race for world first in new game releases? What else can you imagine is directly proportional to Team Builders success! Let's go Team! Thanks always, to our Heroes like Richard Simmons, Billy Blanks, and the rest of our heart-healthy leaders, whom had inspiration right the entire time! "Let's go, people! Work it! Yeah!" ~Simmons fired up! You get the idea! Together, we put the Capital T in Team!
