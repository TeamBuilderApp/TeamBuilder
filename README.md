# TeamBuilder

Welcome to Team Builder!

Welcome to our new repo! We are currently open source.

Need a Team? The idea is to build a Team for anything and everything! Video games, sports, etc. The most quick and simple roster mechanics, for the maximum playtime! Now that's efficiency! Also designed in a way where all other team building apps can all work together using a common roster language! This includes anywhere at all where a team roster is hosted, any app, any website, and any upload. The final tool would solve for the mechanics of the team itself, using a common roster parser. Basically, any and all roster(s) have the same common pieces, and that never changes no matter what! Simply upload or link any roster via TeamBuilders Web API call. You only call a URL, upload roster, or text, or automatically POST to TeamBuilder API, and that's it! You're now hosting a roster in a common central roster share. You are either the Host or the Player. Host(s) see player(s), and player(s) see Host(s).

The idea of joining or hosting a team, became an ever increasing need of mine, shortly after college, (a tech school). Playing sports was simply not satisfying alone, along with many different events such as, gaming, pick-up-games, and other events where a team could or would enable playtime. I soon noticed that the need for a team became more common than ever! As a gamer, my friends and I studied how to prepare, to have the edge of efficiency, during new game releases also! This included anything where a team could be of bonus, advantage, or the key to playing at all, such as player vs player ranking also! As I played sports, I began attending many pick-up-games, in order to play more frequently, as well as to increase my play-time efficiency. As games commonly ended early due to roster and attendance or recruiting lack thereof. I began to study the overall-challenge, and noticed that much more time was spent hoping and trying to convince those that had to go, to stay, and noticed much more time was spent managing or not playing. I sadly endured, with my other co-team members, how much more time was spent enduring the roster, or trying to get everyone to stay, so that the team would not crumble early or could remain longer, as games just were not promising on a routine attendance.

I also desired a way to have a full team for an extended or routine amount of time. I desired to fill in empty positions without missing the new game release, push for a world-first achievement, or sporting events, where a full team was needed for a satisfying accurate game. Quick and reliable plug and play for empty spots was key when trying to have a full game experience.

What Does This Product Deliver?
This team building product will deliver, upon solving for the team itself, hosting or playing, defined. Maximum efficiency, means that your team has the highest chance to refill automatically, for the smoothest turnover replacement, substitute, and that players will have the highest chance to find a team. Upon solving for this tool, both host and player, are garanteed the highest chance that you will have the maximum playtime, with the least amount of downtime! This means that the least amount of time managing, or fumbling distraction, and the MAXIMUM amount of time playing, or attending any hosted event! 

Efficiency continued:
TeamBuilder is not doing anything out of the ordinary, it's just automating everything possible for maximum play time, at the least amount of downtime. For maximum or more frequently desired playtime, even availability as a list of choices. Together, we will put the Capital 'T' in Team, once TeamBuilder's design is solved for! Upon this team building tool design delivering the most efficiency, and feels like an integral tool, then TeamBuilder too will now have the Capital T in it's Team building ability. Efficiency delivered, at the most simple use. 


TeamBuilder applies to more than just sports and games, it solves for the mechanics of building any and all team(s) by definition! TeamBuilder will work for anything and everything possible, where a team is needed! Examples of use include, sports, church groups, anything that apps like meetup.com (or similar) host, events, school events, games, after-school pick-up-games, sports, sports practice training, fishing, announced games, world-first groups, professional, casual to parse-perfection ranking, any roster, for any event, imagine the potential! Unlock your imagination, host it, or search for any team, the design is the key to almost any success! Solving for the mechanics of what it takes to build, host, and join a team, keep a team going, solves for the Capital 'T' in Team, aka solves for the mechanics of the team itself.

Overall Goals:
This idea does not claim to need anything other than 'free contribution' until the Patent/Trademark etc. can be legally funded. Considering this the free market for now, and encourage all to participate.

About me:
I have been simply an inventor minded person since childhood. I also love software engineering and using the latest technology. I also love to make something that is highly needed, that currently is a challenge (or save man hours through automation), designed and built into a smooth automated process to produce success for those around the World, and even for my own success. All ideas are encouraged!

The analogy, and what is the truth behind the fuel to build and solve is actually inspiration!:

Where did **TeamBuilder** come from?

My open source hobby project! TeamBuilder is the name of one of the greatest world wide issues that I am developing a solution for, everyone is a part of the Team if they want to at no cost to you! It's also how I practiced Web API and the latest REST technologies during a lengthy interview process, what more could I ask for? This was the perfect study leading into the future challenges of building a Team for anything and everything possible!

The long term idea is for the world's first pick up group to beat a real professional team, (as the fun proof), of TeamBuilder's ultimate success! Imagine being actually prepared to race for world first in new game releases? What else can you imagine is directly proportional to Team Builders progress! It's never work, your inspiration is the proven real contribution. You can't own and inspire at the same time, the success will be how inspired each and every person (including the need for a Team Builder app/tool) we are going into a worldly challenge therefore worldly inspiration is directly proportional to the exact success/solution hence TeamBuilder's global purpose to work with ANY other TeamBuilder or roster API feed, using simply a common roster language! This proves that the more Team Builders the better if we're all on this Team together. This fun proof puts the literal capital T in Team! How cool was this to discover as a hobby and inventor mindset engineer myself AKA, and to tackle the most frustrating issue that anyone that takes any event seriously in terms of reliable fairness and competitiveness, you can take the week off and Team Builder should plug and play ANY roster for anything ever that can require a 1 or more person Team. The solution is putting the literal Capital T in Team together as this global Team we are! See the awesomeness? Here comes the inspiration! Let's go Team! Our Heroes like Richard Simmons, Billy Blanks, and the rest of our heart healthy leaders had it right the whole time! "Let's go, people! Work it! Yeah!" ~Simmons fired up! You get the idea! Now just don't forget what I said generates inspiration because all we need is that capital T in Team! Yeah! See Github for more info! We put the Capital T in Team!
